# Rainbow Hunt
Rainbow Hunt is a hyper-casual game in the style of Temple Run and Subway Surfers. In this game, we control a balloon. The balloon changes color by collecting colorful cubes on the road. If the balloon and the road we are progressing on are the same color, the balloon starts to deflate. If they are different colors, the balloon inflates and eventually bursts. Thus, there is a single road, but it comes in different colors.

## Introduction / Description
Welcome to the world of Rainbow Hunt! This is a dynamic, hyper-casual game that provides a unique twist on the endless running genre. Here, you control an ever-advancing balloon soaring through a vibrant path that unfolds with a riot of colors.

The gameplay's beauty lies in its simplicity and color dynamics. Our balloon character doesn't just drift in the air; it feeds on colorful cubes scattered along the path, each ingestion altering its color. But here's the catch - the color of the balloon and the path must always match! If they do, the balloon begins to deflate to normal size. However, when the balloon color contrasts with the path, it begins to inflate until it cannot withstand the pressure and finally bursts! This brings a strategic aspect to the game, compelling the player to change colors meticulously, thus creating an exhilarating gaming experience.

## How to Play
Rainbow Hunt is as engaging as it is simple to play. Your character, the balloon, is on a constant forward move through a path laden with colorful cubes. The goal? Collect these cubes and keep changing the balloon's color.

But be careful! If your balloon and the path are different colors, the balloon will start to inflate and an over-inflated balloon will burst, meaning it's game over! On the contrary, if the balloon and the path are same in color, the balloon will deflate until it reaches its normal size and you will be out of danger! This balance of inflation and deflation, of matching and contrasting, is the core of Rainbow Hunt's gameplay. Constant vigilance on the balloon's color and timely color changes to maintain contrast with the path are the key to achieving a high score in this exciting, fast-paced game.

So, what are you waiting for? Hop on this vibrant journey and test your skills in Rainbow Hunt!
